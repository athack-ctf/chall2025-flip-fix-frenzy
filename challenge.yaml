    "Jester, the creation of brilliance and desperation, was meant to solve the unsolvable.
    But as its creators, Roger and Ned, pushed the limits of AI, Jester's answers became shrouded in mystery.
    Its memory now lies fragmented across three binary files—**distorted**, **encoded**, and layered with **secrecy**.
    Within the last fragment lies the truth they feared: a hidden message that could rewrite everything they believed.

    Patterns hold the key to Jester's encrypted mind—subtle redundancies and structured bits waiting to be untangled. Reconstruct what's broken, correct what's flawed, and decode the buried truth."

    Good luck, agents! Your path begins with the fragments.
