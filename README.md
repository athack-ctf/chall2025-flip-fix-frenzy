> "Jester, the creation of brilliance and desperation, was meant to solve the unsolvable.
> But as its creators, Roger and Ned, pushed the limits of AI, Jester's answers became shrouded in mystery.
> Its memory now lies fragmented across three binary files—**distorted**, **encoded**, and layered with **secrecy**.
> Within the last fragment lies the truth they feared: a hidden message that could rewrite everything they believed.
> 
> Patterns hold the key to Jester's encrypted mind—subtle redundancies and structured bits waiting to be untangled. Reconstruct what's broken, correct what's flawed, and decode the buried truth."
> 
> Good luck, agents! Your path begins with the fragments.
